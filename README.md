## Objectives

- [x] Good WAI-ARIA support

- [x] Custom rendering of elements
- [x] Excellent test coverage
- [x] Zero dependencies

## Compatibility

This project is aiming for wide compatibility in **modern** and **supported** browsers.

This means that **no versions of IE**, or legacy versions of Safari (before 10) are supported.

If you have to support legacy browsers in your project, you likely already have a transpiling setup and know how to use polyfills.

[`eslint-plugin-compat`][compat] is used to ensure contributors are aware when they introduce compatibility issues.
